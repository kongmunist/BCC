# Body Channel Communication

Welcome! This repository contains the code to run the body channel communication final project made for the CMU course Building User-Focused Sensing Systems, described [here](http://andykong.org/blog/bcc3).

The `receiver_simple` contains the receiver code, so by process of elimination the `clockcheck` file contains the transmitter.
